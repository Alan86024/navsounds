# Navigation Sounds

Navigation Sounds is an NVDA screen reader add-on that provides audio feedback for navigation and keyboard typing. It allows you to hear different sounds based on the roles of the elements you interact with and customize your experience.

## About

This add-on is inspired by the abandoned "objsounds" add-on created by Tyler Spivey. Since that add-on hasn't been updated for a long time, we've created this add-on to continue providing similar functionality while keeping up with the changes in the NVDA screen reader.

## Features

- Easily toggle object sounds and keyboard typing sounds on and off using the keyboard shortcut NVDA+alt+n. You can also customize these settings through the NVDA menu Preferences > Input gestures > Navigation Sounds.
- Access a settings page where you can choose from various navigation sound packages and keyboard typing sound effects, as well as configure additional options.
- Includes a selection of sound packages and typing keyboard sound effects, with the ability to create and add your custom packages.
- Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly with modern NVDA versions, starting from 2019.3.
- Available in multiple languages, including English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Danish, Polish, and Chinese.
- Watch a video about it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Gw28CDzrA) (in Arabic).
