# nav Sounds
This is an NVDA screen reader add-on that provides navigation sounds based on different roles when interacting with the screen reader.

## About


This add-on is inspired by the abandoned "objsounds" add-on created by Tyler Spivey. Since that add-on hasn't been updated for a long time, I decided to create this add-on to continue providing similar functionality while keeping up with the changes in the NVDA screen reader.


## Features

- Provides navigation sounds based on different roles.
- Toggle Functionality: Easily switch between enabling and disabling object sounds and toggling object type reading with a simple keyboard gesture.
- Customization: Access a settings page where you can choose from various navigation sound packages and configure additional options.
- Expandable:  includes a selection of sound packages, and you can even create and add your custom packages.

- Compmpatibility: Designed to seamlessly work with modern NVDA versions, starting from 2019.3 and later.
