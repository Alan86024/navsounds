# navsounds

This is an NVDA screen reader add-on that provides navigation sounds based on different roles when interacting with the screen reader.

## About

This add-on is inspired by the abandoned "objsounds" add-on created by Tyler Spivey. Since that add-on hasn't been updated for a long time, I decided to create this add-on to continue providing similar functionality while keeping up with the changes in the NVDA screen reader.

## Features

- Provides navigation sounds based on different roles.
- Toggle the navigation sounds on and off using a keyboard gesture.
- Designed to work with NVDA version 2019.3 and later.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases 	](https://github.com/ahmedthebest31/navsounds/releases) section.
2. Open the NVDA screen reader.
3. Navigate to the NVDA menu -> Tools -> Manage add-ons.
4. Click the "Install" button and select the downloaded add-on file.
5. Restart NVDA.

## Usage

- The navigation sounds will play based on the roles of objects as you interact with NVDA.
- To toggle the navigation sounds on or off, use the keyboard gesture: NVDA+Shift+Delete.
