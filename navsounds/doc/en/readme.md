This add-on is inspired by the abandoned "objsounds" add-on created by Tyler Spivey. Since that add-on hasn't been updated for a long time, I decided to create this add-on to continue providing similar functionality while keeping up with the changes in the NVDA screen reader.

- Customization: Access a settings page where you can choose from various navigation sound packages / keyboard typing sound effects and configure additional options.
- Expandable:  includes a selection of sound packages / typing keyboard sound effects, and you can even create and add your custom packages.

- Compmpatibility: Designed to seamlessly work with modern NVDA versions, starting from 2019.3 and later.
